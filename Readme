## Home Health Monitoring using Deep Transfer Learning & Edge Computing
This project presents a Deep Transfer Learning-based Edge Computing solution for home health monitoring, with a specific focus on fall detection from RGB images. Built using Python, Keras, OpenCV, and socket programming, it leverages a pretrained VGG16 model and a GUI interface via Tkinter for seamless interaction and real-time health data transmission to the cloud.

## 📌 Abstract
With the rise in aging populations and chronic diseases, remote health monitoring is becoming increasingly essential. This system integrates AI-driven fall detection with edge computing and cloud communication, enabling caregivers and healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely and respond promptly to health incidents like falls.

## 🧠 Features
📁 Dataset Upload -Load a fall detection dataset via GUI

🤖 Model Loading - Load pretrained VGG16-based transfer learning model

🧍‍♂️ Fall Detection -  Detects falls from RGB images using deep learning

☁️ Cloud Communication - Sends detected results and image frames to cloud via sockets

💬 GUI Interface - Built using Tkinter for intuitive user experience

🧠 Edge Processing -  Runs detection locally and sends results to a centralized server
